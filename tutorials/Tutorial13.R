# We're interested in whether women promote different policies than men?
# Load in this dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv
# On drinking water facilities and a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, 13 of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women
# Estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages
# Hint: t.test(y ~ x, alternative="two.sided")
# Effectively plot this difference
